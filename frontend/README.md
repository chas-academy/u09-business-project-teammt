# My Cookbooks - Frontend

A React-based recipe management application that allows users to search, save, and organize their favorite recipes using Google OAuth authentication.

- Search thousands of recipes from the Spoonacular API
- Create custom cookbook collections
- Save and organize favorite recipes
- Access their personal recipe collection anywhere

## üîê Google OAuth Integration

This application uses Google OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication:

- **Secure Login**: No passwords to remember - use your existing Google account
- **Personal Data**: Each user's cookbooks and recipes are private and isolated
- **Token-based**: Uses JWT tokens for secure API communication
- **Automatic Redirect**: Seamless login flow with redirect back to the app

The OAuth flow is handled by:
1. Frontend redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
2. User authorizes the application
3. Google redirects back with authorization code
4. Backend exchanges code for user info and creates session
5. Frontend receives authentication token for API calls
